    <p>
      At some point in your life, someone may have told you to find a wife in Manila. Since you’re here, maybe some part
      of you thinks that you should too.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’ve tried pursuing local women, but the chemistry is just not there. Your values are different. Your goals and
      sense of fulfillment aren’t the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most Western men simply want a traditional wife with whom they can start a loving family. A wife they can happily
      spend the rest of their lives with.
    </p>

    <div class="img-caption pull-right imgRight-fifty">

      <cite> Go on a singles vacation and meet the gorgeous women of Manila! </cite>
    </div>

    <p>
      And here you are, in search of a wife among Manila women. But what is the success rate? How can you be sure that
      an enticing <a href="https://manila-women.com/blog/filipina-karaoke-dates.html">woman from Manila</a> would be
      interested in marrying you?
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, there were 15,047 marriages between Filipinos and foreign
      nationals in 2019, 89.3% of which were between Filipino women and foreign men. Based on that number, 26.8%
      comprises American men, which is the highest number of intermarriages with Filipino women.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that more and more American men are finding suitable life partners among Filipino women, and vice
      versa.
    </p>
    <p>You might even know someone – a relative, co-worker, or friend – who ended up marrying a Filipino woman.</p>
    <p>That being said, has marrying a Filipino woman ever crossed your mind?</p>
    <p>
      In this article, we’ll be discussing the reasons why women in Manila, or Filipino women in general, make ideal
      partners when it comes to lasting love and a successful marriage.

      Manila women who are looking for love.

    <h2>Endearing Traits and Qualities of Manila Women</h2>

    <p>
      If there’s one thing Filipinos are known for, it’s their hospitality. With that comes their warm smiles and
      friendly attitudes. This is especially true among the women.
    </p>

    <p>
      But if you’re looking for wife-material qualities, you’ll be happy to know that women in Manila are known to be:
    </p>

    <h3>Family-centered</h3>

    <p>
      Filipino culture is big on familial relationships. Many of the country’s traditions and celebrations are centered
      on family. For women, it’s just as meaningful to them to uphold the values that help keep their family intact.
    </p>

    <p>
      A Manila woman will carry this influence with her until old age, as most Filipino households care for one another
      despite having families of their own. This means that extended family members, relatives, and elders can all live
      under the same roof. If not, in the same neighborhood.
    </p>

    <h3>Smart</h3>

    <p>
      Street smart and book smart. As of 2021, the Philippine Statistics Authority stated that there are an estimated
      1.83 million Overseas Filipino Workers, the majority of whom are women. This means that Filipinos go above and
      beyond to provide for their families. They take their studies seriously in order to pursue fulfilling careers by
      the time they become adults.
    </p>

    <p>
      For them, getting a job abroad is much more valuable in terms of salary, career opportunities, and working
      environments.
    </p>

    <h3>Approachable</h3>

    <p>
      Ask anyone you know who’s been to the Philippines. The people there are so friendly and well versed in the English
      language that you won’t have a hard time connecting with them. So many foreigners have formed lasting bonds with
      Filipinos throughout their stay.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether it’s asking for directions or what the best food in town is, approaching a beautiful lady in Manila
      shouldn’t be a problem. Just remember to always be courteous and polite.
    </p>

    <h3>Sensitive</h3>

    <p>
      Filipinos value their sense of honor. Others might refer to it as their reputation. They understand the negative
      effects of being shamed, especially in public. As much as possible, they don’t want to cause a scene where their
      honor or reputation might be questioned.
    </p>

    <p>
      When it comes to the women, however, they tend to be more sensitive towards other people. They are classy and
      feminine that way. While there are some who have strong opinions and personalities, the majority are soft-spoken
      and reserved.
    </p>

    <h3>Compassionate</h3>

    <p>
      Based on the aforementioned qualities, it’s not hard to imagine how kind and loving a Filipina wife can be. The
      same goes for who she is as a person. One of the best traits of a Manila woman is that she can be selfless to the
      point that helping other people is more important than tending to her own needs.

    <h2>Why You Should Find Your Bride in Manila</h2>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://manila-women.com/blog/things-filipino-women-love-to-do.html">women of Manila</a> are not only
      marriage-material, they’re marriage-minded too. Marriage can mean so many things to so many people, but for
      Filipinos, it’s a milestone that marks the beginning of a new life – a new life where they get to start their own
      family.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although divorce remains illegal in the Philippines, it is also rare for women in the country to take it as an
      option. Some people also see it as a benefit. Since divorce has never been legalized, married couples have gotten
      used to sticking to their marriages despite any hardships.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s different when you know you have divorce as an option. The fact that marriage entails lifelong commitment, it
      shouldn’t be that easy to know you can just separate once you realize you no longer want to be together with your
      spouse.
    </p>

    <p>
      That being said, the mindset of Filipino women is that if you marry someone, it’s the real deal. Now, who wouldn’t
      want a wife who understands and values the concept of marriage?

      partner. All the women registered on our site have been screened and verified for a safe and productive
      international dating experience.

    </p>

    <h3>Exploring the Best Spots in Manila</h3>

    <p>
      Make the most of our exciting tours by immersing yourself in the culture of Manila and its incredible attractions.
      As the capital of the Philippines, it has a bustling city life where you can appreciate the modern architecture
      and recreational activities that both locals and tourists can enjoy.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are also a number of historical sites if you want to get to know the city more. All of this will be in a
      detailed itinerary with a set schedule so you don’t miss out on the entire experience.
    </p>

    <p>But wait, there’s more! You have the option to join our tour individually or with a group.</p>

    <h4>Group Tours</h4>

    <p>
      This is our most famous tour. You will get to attend the socials, go on city tours, and meet hundreds of women (if
      not all who are present during the tour). It’s your very own singles vacation. You will also be joined by fellow
      single lads who are interested in meeting the women.
    </p>

    <h4>Individual Tours</h4>

    <p>
      While there are no socials events or city tours for this, you will have one-on-one introductions with a set number
      of ladies. This is best for more intimate interactions with the woman you’re interested in.
    </p>

    <p>
      Though both tours have their own schedules and packages, they’re an effective method to get to know potential
      partners in Manila. Keep in mind that the best way to build lasting connections is by meeting the women in person.
      We highly encourage you to go see them face-to-face.
